# Homework

Create your own (TDD) library class with an internal collection of books.

**helpful note -** start by making your Book class first as your library takes in a collection of books.  If you notice an import at the top of your test and/or library class which looks like this `import java.awt.print.Book;` delete it.  This is not your Book class that you've created.

## MVP

* Write a method to count the number of books in the library.
* Write a method to add a book to the library stock.
* Add a capacity to the library and write a method to check if stock is full before adding a book.  

## Extensions:
* Add a third class which interacts with the other two. E.g. you could add a `Borrower` with a method that takes a `Book` and moves to the `Borrower`'s collection.
* Add a property for the genre of books. (e.g. thriller, crime, etc.)

## Advanced Extension
* The library wants to keep track of it's number of books by genre. Using a HashMap, store the Genre of each book as the key - and a count of how many books of that genre as the value.
